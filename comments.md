## Comments should:
1. Explain the code in "non-code" terms, and (if possible) what it's accomplishing in the grand scheme of things

	  BAD
	  ```ruby
	  # get each user as u and set u.password to md5
	  User.each do |u|
	  	u.password = Digest::MD5.new()
	  end
	```
	  GOOD
	  ```ruby
	  # In case we get hacked, this will generate an MD5 hash for all users passwords in the database
	  User.each do |u|
	  	u.password = Digest::MD5.new()
	  end
	```
2. Be well formatted, in clear english, and consistent in your patterns

	  BAD
	  ```ruby
	  # geet each users As u...
	  User.each do |u|
	  	u.password = Digest::MD5.new() # set u.password too randum md5
	  end
	```
	  GOOD
	  ```ruby
	  # We are iterating through each user in the database
	  User.each do |u|
	  	# We are generating an MD5 hash for their password
	  	u.password = Digest::MD5.new()
	  end
	```

3. Explain what the code is doing. But, only when its non-obvious / needed for clarification.

	  BAD
	  ```ruby
	  # get all the paid users
	  paid_users = User.paid
	  ```
	  GOOD
	  ```ruby
	  paid_users = User.paid
	```
## Comments should NOT:
1. Explain functions or methods that are part of the language and or framework
2. Be lengthy or cumbersome to read.
3. Simply repeat what the code says if they code is obviousâ€“ it causes clutter

	BAD
	// get the terms of the taxonomy
	```php
  	$terms = get_terms($taxonomyname, array('hide_empty' => 0));
	```
  	GOOD
  	```php
	$terms = get_terms($taxonomyname, array('hide_empty' => 0));
	```
