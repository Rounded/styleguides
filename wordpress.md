# Wordpress and You

Wordpress is very confusing, but here are some conventions that everyone must abide by so we don't produce shitty work.

## Filenames and structure
Do not use underscores in filenames in the wp-content folder. It doesn't make any sense and ends up causing a headache when trying to search for files. 

You never access any of the files in the wp-content directly (from the site), so none of the filenames need to be "_header.php" or "_something.php"
