# PHP

This looks more like a wiki that a style guide. I'll think about changing this up...

## Inspecting variables
To get info on a variable use the following code:

  ```php
  <pre>
  <? var_dump($variable); ?>
  </pre>
  ```

```var_dump();``` will dump the variable and the ```<pre />``` tag will format the code so that it's easier to read.
